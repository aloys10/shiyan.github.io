I'm a last year undergraduate student from [School of Cyber Science and engineering](https://cse.whu.edu.cn), [Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn/). My research interest includes side-channel attacks, AI security, machine learning, and privacy computing.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Ou Changhai](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Changhai-Ou), Wuhan University.

You can find my CV here: [Shi Yan's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
