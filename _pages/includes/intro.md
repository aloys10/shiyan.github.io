# üßê About Me

Hi there! I am a graduate student in [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk), major in [MSc Machine Learning](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/graduate/taught-degrees/machine-learning-msc).


<!-- Previously, I interned at Sony AI for half a year, focusing on AI security and model compression. Before that, I also interned at Tencent Youtu Lab for one year, exploring federated learning and adversarial attacks. -->

During my Bachelor‚Äôs studies, my research interests centered on the intersection of cryptography and AI security, particularly focusing on side-channel attacks (e.g., Side Channel Collision Attacks in AES, side-channel-based model inversion), adversarial machine learning (adversarial examples, transfer attacks), and privacy computing (federated learning). This work has given me a solid understanding of privacy and robustness challenges in AI, especially in computer vision and large language models.

Currently, I‚Äôm seeking internship opportunities in search and recommendation system. Additionally, I‚Äôve been actively exploring Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and large language models to broaden my skill set and apply my knowledge to real-world applications in information retrieval, recommendation systems. If you have relevant projects or collaboration opportunities, I would love to connect!
