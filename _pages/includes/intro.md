# üßê About Me

Hi there! I am a last-year bachelor student in [School of Cyber Science and engineering](https://cse.whu.edu.cn), under the supervision of [Prof. Ou Changhai](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Changhai-Ou).


<!-- Previously, I interned at Sony AI for half a year, focusing on AI security and model compression. Before that, I also interned at Tencent Youtu Lab for one year, exploring federated learning and adversarial attacks. -->

**Research Interests**: My primary focus lies at the intersection of Cryptography and AI security, delving into areas such as side channel attacks, adversarial machine learning, and privacy computing. My research revolves around the following key domains:

- Side Channel Attack: Side Channel Collision Attack in AES, Side Channel for Model Inversion
- Adversarial Machine Learning: Adversarial Examples, Transfer Attack 
- Privacy Computing: Studying Federated Learning

ü§î In my future pursuits, I am deeply engaged in exploring the nuances of privacy and robustness within Artificial Intelligence, particularly in the realms of computer vision and LLMs (Large Language Models).
